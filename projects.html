                        <summary>Portfolio Website</summary>
                        <p>This Project is the Website that you are currently looking at, it includes multiple pages as well as a slideshow, a API caller that pulls a quote of the day. It also has CSS styling and a light and dark mode switcher</p>

                        <summary>Weather Website</summary>
                        <p>This Website was created for my web development class. It called an API using an API key and displayed the current weather of any requested city. it was also capable of displaying a 5 day forcast for any requested city on another page.</p>

                        <summary>Maze Generator</summary>
                        <p>This Porject was the final project of my object orientyed programing class, it generated mazes of any size of a few diffrent types using a few diffrent generation methods, in addition to this it included a method of playing the maze by displaying it in the console and allowing the user to move around in the maze using the arrow keys. also included in this program was monsters and upgrades that wandered the maze to make exploring it more difficult</p>

                        <summary>Java AI framework</summary>
                        <p>This I created out of my own curiosity outside of my classes. it was a basic nural network for machine learning that had a configurable size and activation function. in addition to this I also implemented a way to do backpropigation. by giving it a set of inputs as well as the target output it could shift its weights to make it more closely conform to the target output</p>

                        <summary>GO web scraper</summary>
                        <p>This Project was also created in my free time, it was a python script that scraped GO gameplay data from an online play website, the scraping had a few requirements in addition to the normal stuff, for example the GO website did not have a built in way of listing all games or all players, it't only interface was to search for a specific player and pull their past games, so was I ended up doing was to eventually guess a players username, pull all of their games, then sort through those games and find who their opponents are and then use that list of opponents to find their games and repeat the process.</p>

                        <summary>GO data cleaning</summary>
                        <p>This project was made in my free time to clean up a bunch of GO gameplay data. this data was in an enweildy format and contained a lot of unesseary information as well as ocassinally contained branches where players went back to previose game states, this project took out all of the unesseary parts of the data, took out the game branches.</p>

                        <summary>GO AI training</summary>
                        <p>this was also completed in my free time, the goal of this project was to train an AI to play GO, I used the AI framework in java that I created as well as gameplay data that I had scraped to acomplish this, it required making a GO emulator that tracked board state and took stones off the board when nesseary. I then fed in the gameplay data to create lists of board states as well as the correct next move. I then rotated and flipped each training set to multiply my data by 8 because GO is the same rotated or flipped. I then fed the current board state as well as the correct next move into my Nural network as the input and the target output. this was unsucessful and my AI was ultimarly unable to adequetly learn the game but it did show the ability to beat a random bot most of the time.</p>

                        <summary>Integration Aproximation</summary>
                        <p>This project was created to assist me in my statistics class. it was created to create the aproximation of an integral, in the case of my primary use it was able to aproximate the area under the normal curve. it did this via trapazoidal aproximation and is a general solution for any equation I could possible make.</p>

                        <summary>Polynomial Factorer</summary>
                        <p>I created this project to assist me in my Math class. it was able to take in a polynomial of any length and completly factor it via synthetic division. it was also able to handel fractional coefficents and I created an entire fraction class to handel this functionality</p>

                        <summary>Skull King AI</summary>
                        <p>I created this as my final to the intro to AI class. it created an AI that could play the card game Skull King. I did this by first creating a system that can emulate skull king gameplay. then creating a random play bot that played against itself to create sevral thousand random games. I then built a system that looks at the AI's current hand and filters the random gameplay data to what is the few hundred most relevant  bits of data, it then has an AI look at the past data and predict what the best next move would be based on the outcomes of the random data. in the end it proved to be quite sucessful even beating human players</p>
